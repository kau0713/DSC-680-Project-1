# Pregnancies and Glucose Level Analysis

This project explores the relationship between the number of pregnancies and blood glucose levels, using a dataset of medical records to analyze patterns and trends. The project is part of the coursework for DSC680.

## Project Overview

The primary objective is to investigate whether the number of pregnancies impacts glucose levels in the blood. Various statistical and visualization methods are employed to understand the data, including:

- Histograms for key variables
- Descriptive statistics
- Probability Mass Function (PMF)
- Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)
- Regression analysis
- Hypothesis testing

## Key Features

- **Data Visualization:** Includes histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps to illustrate relationships between variables.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Employs measures such as skewness, kurtosis, and correlation to describe data distributions.
- **Hypothesis Testing:** Uses tests like the Shapiro-Wilk test and Spearman rank correlation to validate assumptions.
- **Regression Analysis:** Explores the relationship between age and blood pressure as a supplemental analysis.

## Technologies Used

- **Python Libraries:**
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `scipy`
  - `seaborn`
  - `statsmodels`
- **Data Source:** [Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)

## Results

Key insights include:
- The Spearman rank correlation coefficient between pregnancies and glucose levels is 0.13, indicating a weak positive correlation.
- Age is found to have a statistically significant, albeit sm
